Data: [http://archive.org/stream/pubscollectionof00tomluoft#page/48/mode/thumb](http://archive.org/stream/pubscollectionof00tomluoft#page/48/mode/thumb)

This uses a very simple Markov Chain function to generate a new pub name from the 2794 currently listed in the file `pub-list.txt` extracted from the web page above! :-P

### Usage

Download the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/unprovable/pub-name-generator.git`

`python ./pubgen.py`
